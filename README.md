# Debian Trixie (13) on Intel MacBook — Complete Offline WiFi Bootstrap Kit

**Status:** Verified Working — April 2026
**Maintained by:** Willard
**Target Hardware:** Intel MacBooks (2012–2019) with Broadcom BCM43xx WiFi

---

## ⚠️ Compatibility Notice

**This repository is for Intel MacBooks only.**

Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3, M4 — released 2020 onwards) use a
completely different CPU architecture (ARM) and are not supported by
this guide. Apple Silicon Linux support is handled by the separate
Asahi Linux project.

Intel MacBooks covered by this guide include most models from
approximately 2010 to 2019, specifically those with Broadcom BCM43xx
series WiFi chips. The guide was developed and verified on a MacBook
Air Mid-2015 but should work on any Intel MacBook with a Broadcom
WiFi chip running Debian 13 Trixie amd64.

---

## Why This Repository Exists

This repository serves as the documentation and instructions hub for
getting a freshly installed Debian 13 (Trixie) system connected to the
internet on an Intel MacBook — entirely offline, using nothing but a
USB stick. The actual package files are hosted across three platforms
due to GitHub's file size limitations, all linked in the Download
section below.

The machine used to develop and verify this guide is a 2015 Intel
MacBook Air with a dual-core Intel Core i5 and 8GB of RAM. The
migration to Debian was driven by a straightforward reason: macOS
Monterey — the last version of macOS Apple supports on this hardware
— had become increasingly unusable due to high idle RAM consumption,
leaving very little headroom for actual work. With Apple having
officially ended support for this machine, the only path forward was
a full OS migration.

Debian Trixie was chosen for its stability, package freshness, and
long-term support. This repository documents everything that was needed
to bridge the gap between a working Debian install and a working
internet connection — a gap that turns out to be surprisingly wide on
MacBook hardware due to Broadcom's proprietary WiFi chips.

If you found this repository by searching for how to install Debian
Trixie on an Intel MacBook, or how to get WiFi working on Debian
without internet access, you are in exactly the right place.

## Understanding the Problem Before You Start

### The Netinst Trap

The standard way to install Debian on any machine is to use the
`netinst` ISO — a small installer image that downloads the rest of the
system from the internet during installation. This works perfectly on
hardware with open-source-compatible network cards. MacBooks are not
that hardware.

MacBooks from roughly 2010 onwards use Broadcom WiFi chipsets from the
BCM43xx family. These chips are not supported by any open-source driver
that ships with the Linux kernel by default. The only driver that
reliably works is `broadcom-sta-dkms`, a proprietary driver distributed
separately that must be compiled from source against your specific
running kernel at install time.

This compilation requires:
- The GCC compiler toolchain
- Your kernel's header files
- The DKMS framework and its own dependencies
- Dozens of supporting libraries

None of these are present on a minimal Debian install. And you cannot
download them because you have no WiFi. And you cannot get WiFi because
you do not have them.

This is the Netinst Trap — a classic chicken-and-egg problem that has
frustrated MacBook Linux users for years. This repository is the bridge.

### What This Repository Does

Every single `.deb` file needed to break this dependency loop has been
manually identified, downloaded, and verified. You download them from
any of the mirrors listed below, transfer them to a USB stick on any
machine that has internet access, carry them into your new Debian
install, and install them all at once. DKMS then compiles the Broadcom
driver against your kernel, and you are online.

Once you are online, `apt` handles everything from that point forward
and you will never need to do this manually again.

Once downloaded, organize all `.deb` files into a single flat folder
on your USB stick. Do not use subfolders — the install command targets
everything in the current directory with a wildcard.

## What Is in the Package Collection

The packages fall into several logical groups. Understanding what each
group does will help you troubleshoot if something goes wrong.

### The Driver Itself
- `broadcom-sta-dkms` — the proprietary Broadcom STA wireless driver source
- `dkms` — the Dynamic Kernel Module Support framework that compiles and manages the driver

### Kernel Build Requirements
- `linux-headers-6.12.73+deb13-amd64` — architecture-specific kernel headers
- `linux-headers-6.12.73+deb13-common` — common kernel headers shared across architectures
- `linux-kbuild-6.12.73+deb13` — kernel build scripts required by DKMS
- `pahole` and `dwarves` — debug info tools required by the kernel build process

### Compiler Toolchain
- `gcc-14`, `gcc-14-x86-64-linux-gnu` — the GNU C compiler
- `cpp-14`, `cpp-14-x86-64-linux-gnu` — the C preprocessor
- `binutils`, `binutils-x86-64-linux-gnu`, `binutils-common` — assembler, linker and binary utilities
- `make` — build automation tool
- `patch` — required by DKMS to apply source patches during compilation

### Package Management Tools
- `dpkg-dev` — Debian package development tools, required by DKMS
- `libdpkg-perl` — Perl library that dpkg-dev depends on
- `xz-utils` and `liblzma5` — compression tools required by dpkg-dev

### Core Libraries
A large collection of libraries that the compiler toolchain and kernel
build system depend on, including:
- `libc6`, `libc6-dev`, `libc-dev-bin`, `linux-libc-dev` — C standard library and headers
- `libgcc-14-dev`, `libgcc-s1` — GCC runtime libraries

- `libidn2-0`, `libunistring5` — internationalization libraries
- `libjansson4` — JSON library
- `libgcc-14-dev` — GCC 14 development files

### WiFi Connection Tools
These are needed to actually connect to a network after the driver is built:
- `wpasupplicant` — handles WPA/WPA2 authentication
- `iw` — wireless interface configuration tool
- `libnl-3-200`, `libnl-genl-3-200` — netlink libraries required by iw and wpasupplicant
- `libssl3t64` — SSL library required by wpasupplicant

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide

### Before You Begin

If you have not yet installed Debian on your MacBook, start with
[INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) first — it covers preparing the
hybrid USB, booting the installer, and completing the base system setup
before returning here.

You will need:
- A USB stick with at least 2GB of free space, formatted as FAT32, exFAT, or ext4
- A machine with internet access to download the packages — any OS works
- Your target MacBook booted into a fresh Debian Trixie minimal install
- Your WiFi network name (SSID) and password

---

### Step 1 — Download and Prepare the Packages

Download the full package collection from any of the mirrors listed in
the Download section above. Place all `.deb` files into a single flat
folder — not inside any subfolders. Copy that folder to your USB stick.

---

### Step 2 — Boot Into Debian and Become Root

On your MacBook, boot into Debian. At the login prompt, log in with
your user account, then switch to root:

```
su -
```

Enter your root password when prompted. All commands from this point
forward require root privileges. Note that a minimal Debian install
does not include `sudo` by default — use `su -` throughout this guide
instead of prefixing commands with `sudo`.

---

### Step 3 — Identify Your USB Partition

Plug in the USB stick. The device name Linux assigns to it depends on
what other storage devices are present and the order in which they were
detected at boot — it is not always the same between sessions. Always
confirm the correct device name before attempting to mount anything.

Run:

```
lsblk
```

This displays all block devices and their partitions in a tree format.
Look for a device whose size matches your USB stick — it will appear as
`sdb`, `sdc`, `sdd`, or similar. Its partitions will be listed
underneath as `sdb1`, `sdb2`, etc.

Your files will be on the data partition, which is typically the
largest one. On USB sticks formatted in Windows it is often the second
partition. If you need more detail to identify the right partition, run:

```
lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,FSTYPE,LABEL
```

---

### Step 4 — Mount the USB

Once you have identified the correct partition, mount it:

```
mkdir -p /mnt/usb
mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/usb
```

Replace `sdb2` with the actual partition name from your `lsblk` output.
Then verify your files are present:

```
ls /mnt/usb
```

You should see all your `.deb` files listed. If the directory is empty
or shows unexpected contents, unmount and try a different partition:

```
umount /mnt/usb
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
```

---

### Step 5 — Install All Packages

Navigate into the mounted USB and install everything at once:

```
cd /mnt/usb
dpkg -i *.deb
```

During this pass you will see a significant number of warnings and
dependency error messages. This is completely expected. What is
happening is that `dpkg` is unpacking all 90+ packages simultaneously,
but some cannot finish configuring yet because packages they depend on
have not been configured in the correct order. Everything is being
written to disk — the configuration step that follows will resolve the
ordering.

---

### Step 6 — Configure All Packages

```
dpkg --configure -a
```

This is the most critical step in the entire process. The `-a` flag
instructs dpkg to iterate through every unconfigured package and
complete its setup, now that the full dependency set is available.

This step is also where DKMS will automatically detect the newly
installed kernel headers and compile the Broadcom driver against your
kernel. Watch the output for this line:

```
Building initial module for 6.12.73+deb13-amd64
```

When this appears, the compilation is underway. It typically takes
between 2 and 4 minutes. Do not interrupt the process. Successful
completion will produce:

```
DKMS: build completed.
DKMS: install completed.
```

---

### Step 7 — Audit for Remaining Issues

```
dpkg --audit
```

If the command returns no output, the system is clean and you can
proceed. If it lists any packages, run the following and audit again:

```
dpkg -i *.deb
dpkg --configure -a
dpkg --audit
```

Repeat until the audit produces no output.

---

### Step 8 — Verify the Driver Was Built Successfully

```
dkms status
```

The output should read:

```
broadcom-sta/6.30.223.271, 6.12.73+deb13-amd64, x86_64: installed
```

If the status shows `built` but not `installed`, run:

```
modprobe wl
```

If it shows neither built nor installed, the compilation failed —
refer to the Troubleshooting section.

---

### Step 9 — Load the Driver

The open-source Broadcom drivers (`b43`, `bcma`, `ssb`) may already be
loaded and will conflict with the proprietary `wl` driver. Remove them
first:

```
modprobe -r b43 bcma ssb
```

Then load the proprietary driver:

```
modprobe wl
```

Confirm it loaded successfully:

```
lsmod | grep wl
```

You should see:

```
wl                   6459392  0
cfg80211             1404928  1 wl
```

---

### Step 10 — Bring Up the WiFi Interface

Check your wireless interface name:

```
ip link
```

Look for an interface starting with `wlp` — on the mid-2015 MacBook
Air it is typically `wlp3s0`, but this can vary. Bring it up:

```
ip link set wlp3s0 up
```

Replace `wlp3s0` with your actual interface name throughout the
remaining steps.

---

### Step 11 — Scan for Networks

```
iw wlp3s0 scan | grep SSID
```

You should see a list of nearby WiFi networks. Confirm your network
name appears before proceeding.

---

### Step 12 — Connect to Your Network

Create a WPA configuration file for your network:

```
wpa_passphrase YOUR_NETWORK_NAME YOUR_PASSWORD > /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

Then start the WPA supplicant in the background:

```
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp3s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

---

### Step 13 — Obtain an IP Address

```
dhcpcd wlp3s0
```

You should see confirmation that an address was assigned within a few
seconds.

---

### Step 14 — Verify Connectivity

```
ping -c 3 google.com
```

Three successful replies confirm you are online. You have successfully
bridged the Netinst Trap.

---

### Step 15 — Make WiFi Persistent Across Reboots

The connection established above will not survive a reboot on its own.
Install NetworkManager now that you have internet access:

```
apt install network-manager
```

Enable and start it:

```
systemctl enable NetworkManager
systemctl start NetworkManager
```

Register your network:

```
nmcli device wifi connect YOUR_NETWORK_NAME password YOUR_PASSWORD
```

From this point forward your MacBook will connect to WiFi automatically
on every boot.

---

### Step 16 — Set Up sudo and Complete Your Desktop

Before running the post-installation script you need to set up sudo
for your regular user. Do this while you are still root:

```
usermod -aG sudo yourusername
```

Replace `yourusername` with your actual username. Then exit root:

```
exit
```

Log out and log back in as your regular user for the change to take
effect:

```
logout
```

Now run the post-installation script to set up your full desktop
environment and all MacBook hardware:

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willardcsoriano/debian-intel-macbook-post-install/main/setup.sh)
```

This script installs and configures:
- XFCE desktop environment
- MacBook keyboard fixes (Cmd key, brightness, volume, media keys)
- FaceTime HD webcam and microphone drivers
- Firefox, LibreOffice, VLC, and other essential apps
- NetworkManager GUI (WiFi tray icon, auto-connect on boot)
- Desktop shortcuts and a keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet

## Troubleshooting

### The b43 Error at Boot

You may see the following message during boot:

```
b43 bcma0:1 probe with driver b43 failed with error -95
```

This is harmless. It means the open-source b43 driver attempted to
claim your Broadcom card and was rejected. This is expected — your
card requires the proprietary `wl` driver. The message will appear at
every boot and can be safely ignored.

### DKMS Build Failed

Run `dkms status`. If it does not show `installed`, the compilation
failed. The most common causes are a missing `patch` package or a
missing `pahole` package. Verify both:

```
dpkg -l | grep patch
dpkg -l | grep pahole
```

If either is missing, ensure it was included in your USB package
collection and run `dpkg --configure -a` again.

### Kernel Mismatch

This package set targets kernel `6.12.73+deb13-amd64`. If your system
booted into a different kernel version, the headers will not match and
the DKMS build will fail silently. Check your running kernel:

```
uname -r
```

If the version differs, install the kernel image from this package set
first, reboot into it, then follow this guide from Step 5.

### USB Device Name Changes Between Sessions

Linux assigns device names like `sdb` and `sdc` dynamically at boot.
Always run `lsblk` after plugging in the USB to confirm the current
device name before mounting.

### sudo Not Found

A minimal Debian install does not include sudo. Use `su -` to operate
as root instead. Once you are online, sudo can be installed with
`apt install sudo`.

### dpkg-dev Depends on xz-utils Error

This means xz-utils was not copied to the USB. It is included in the
package collection — verify all files were transferred:

```
ls /mnt/usb | grep xz
```

### Interface Name Is Not wlp3s0

Wireless interface names vary by hardware. Always check your actual
interface name with `ip link` and substitute it wherever `wlp3s0`
appears in this guide.

### wpa_supplicant Fails to Connect

SSIDs and passwords are case-sensitive. Inspect the generated config
to verify correctness:

```
cat /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

The password appears in plain text — confirm it matches exactly.

### My MacBook Has a Non-Broadcom WiFi Chip

Some Intel MacBooks, particularly later models, shipped with Intel
WiFi chips instead of Broadcom. If `lspci | grep -i network` shows an
Intel WiFi adapter, the Intel firmware is included in the Debian
non-free-firmware package and may work out of the box or require a
different offline package set. This repository specifically targets
Broadcom BCM43xx chips.

---

## The Broader Context

This guide was written in April 2026, at a time when a significant
number of Intel MacBooks from the 2013–2017 era are reaching end of
support from Apple. macOS Monterey is the last version available for
many of these machines, and Apple has confirmed there will be no
further security updates.

For users who want to continue using this hardware securely and
productively, Linux is the most viable path forward. Debian Trixie in
particular offers an excellent balance of stability and modernity on
older Intel hardware — it is lightweight, fast, and will receive
security support for years to come.

The single biggest obstacle to this migration is the WiFi problem
documented in this repository. Once it is solved, Debian runs
exceptionally well on mid-2015 MacBook Air hardware. Idle RAM usage is
a fraction of what macOS Monterey consumed, the system is responsive,
and the full Debian package ecosystem is available.

It is hoped that this repository saves other MacBook users the hours
of trial and error that went into building it.

---

## Contributing

If you are running a newer Trixie kernel than `6.12.73`, the
kernel-specific packages in this set will not match. The fix is to
download the matching `linux-headers`, `linux-image`, and
`linux-kbuild` packages for your kernel version from:

```
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/l/linux/
```

And substitute them for the ones in this collection. If you verify
that an updated package set works on a newer kernel, please open a
pull request with the updated files and a note about what changed.

If you test this on a different Intel MacBook model, please open an
issue noting your model (run: sudo dmidecode -s system-product-name),
your Broadcom chip, and whether it worked.
